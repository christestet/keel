For the first public developer-preview release gate, see
[`docs/0.1-release-readiness.md`](0.1-release-readiness.md).

## M1 — Frontend: lexer, parser, AST, diagnostics

| Area | State |
|---|---|
| Span crate (`keelc-span`) | Source IDs, byte spans, spanned values, line/column mapping. |
| Diagnostics crate (`keelc-diag`) | Diagnostic types, stable codes, append-only code registry. |
| Lexer (`keelc-lex`) | Tokenizes Keel Core, newline-terminated, reports `K0102`, `K0906`, `K0004`. |
| AST (`keelc-ast`) | Declarations, types, blocks, statements, expressions, match arms, patterns. |
| Parser (`keelc-parse`) | Modules, declarations, function signatures, types, blocks, expressions, match/catch, tests, rejection forms with stable diagnostics. |
| Driver (`keelc-driver`) | `keelc check <file>` — reads one source file, runs lex+parse, emits `error[K####]` / `warning[K####]` with spans. |
| Conformance runner | Defaults to M1 syntax validation, invokes `keelc check`. |
| KDR surface | KDR-0013 (operators) and KDR-0014 (interpolation brace doubling `{{`/`}}`) lex/parser support integrated. |

**Excluded:** resolver, typechecker, KIR, Go backend, `keel` CLI, formatter beyond AST pretty-printer.

## M2 — Semantic analysis: resolver + typechecker

| Area | State |
|---|---|
| Resolver (`keelc-resolve`) | Immutable assignment and required struct fields with defaults. |
| Type checker | Primitive arithmetic/comparison typing, local `let` inference, `if/else` arm compatibility, string interpolation, selected built-in calls. |
| Exhaustive match | Reports `K0402` for missing enum and built-in `Option`/`Result` variants. |
| `?` typing | Reports `K0501` when enclosing return type cannot absorb propagated `Result`/`Option`. |
| `catch` typing | Reports `K0502` for non-exhaustive error handling. |
| Constructor typing | `Some`, `None`, `Ok`, `Err`, enum variants, `checked_div`, `checked_rem` — temporary type info for the current conformance surface. |

**Not done:** no typed-HIR crate yet; shared type info extracted into `keelc-types` but typechecker still lives in `keelc-resolve`. Generic constructor typing uses `TypeInfo::Unknown` as scaffolding (not the final unification model). Pattern exhaustiveness is whole-variant only, not a general matrix. `K0503` registered but not yet covered by conformance.

## M3 — Go backend

| Area | State |
|---|---|
| Go runtime shim (`keelc-backend-go`) | `KeelEnum`, `Some`/`None`, `Ok`/`Err`, `checked_div`, `checked_rem`, div/rem-by-zero panics with `K0204`. |
| Structs | Declarations, literals, field defaults, nested struct field access. |
| Enums and payloads | Tagged values with payload storage and constructor functions; enum variants can hold struct payloads. |
| `match` | Match expressions and statement-position matches — wildcard arms, guards, payload bindings. |
| `Option` / `Result` | M3 tagged representation. |
| `?` | `let value = expr?` lowers to temporary + early `return`. |
| `catch` | `let value = expr catch err { ... }` — success extraction, matched error arms, `other` fallback. |
| Driver (`keelc-driver`) | `keelc check` and `keelc run`; `run` cleans up its temporary Go build directory. |
| **Conformance score** | **91 / 91 passed** (M3 milestone). Exit criterion met. |

**Known failures:** none.

**Done:** `keelc-kir` crate introduced; backend emits from explicitly-typed KIR.
The resolver/typechecker is the single expression-inference owner and KIR
consumes its span-keyed type results. Shared `TypeContext` declaration tables
remain in `keelc-types`. See
[`docs/m6-simplification-audit.md`](m6-simplification-audit.md).

## M4 — Toolchain skeleton: CLI, fmt, test

| Area | State |
|---|---|
| `keel` / `keelc` binaries | Split `keelc-driver` into a library plus `keel` and `keelc` binary shims. |
| `keel fmt` | Implemented via the AST pretty-printer; idempotent on all M0 accept cases in `tests/conformance/`. |
| `keel build` | Compiles a Keel source file to a native binary via the Go toolchain; artifact is placed next to the source file. |
| `keel test` | Discovers `test "name" { ... }` blocks, runs each in an isolated Go harness, reports assertion failures with source line. |
| Conformance | New cases `702-keel-test-runs-blocks` and `801-keel-build-produces-binary` exercise `keel test` and `keel build` at M4. |

**Known limitations:** formatter strips comments (comments are not stored in the AST). `examples/users-service/main.keel` uses post-Core features and cannot be formatted yet.

## M5 — Language completion wave 1

| Area | State |
|---|---|
| Interfaces | Implemented end-to-end: [`docs/spec/07-interfaces.md`](spec/07-interfaces.md) is ratified, parser/typechecker/Go backend/formatter support nominal interfaces with explicit `impl`. |
| `interface` / `impl` | `interface Name { fn method(self) -> T }` and `impl Interface for Type { ... }` parse, typecheck, and lower to Go interfaces and receiver methods. |
| Method calls | `receiver.method(args)` resolves through explicit impls or interface declarations; dynamically dispatched through interface values. |
| Interface types | Interface names may be used as parameter/return/local types; concrete values assigned to interface types require a matching `impl`. |
| Diagnostics | `K0601`–`K0607` registered and emitted for interface/impl violations. |
| Formatter | `keel fmt` round-trips interface and impl syntax. |
| Conformance | Cases `212-interface-declaration` through `222-impl-extra-method` exercise accept and reject behavior. |

**User generics (done):** [`docs/spec/08-generics.md`](spec/08-generics.md) is
implemented end-to-end. Type parameters are represented as `TypeInfo::TypeParam`
and erased to their bound interface in Go; structs satisfy bounds through their
receiver methods and primitive `impl`s become `keelBox_<Prim>` wrapper types
(Go cannot attach methods to predeclared types). The typechecker emits `K0802`
(method outside the bound, at the definition site) and `K0803` (type argument
fails structural constraint satisfaction, at the call site). Cases `223`–`233`
pass at M5. See [`docs/generics-implementation.md`](generics-implementation.md).

**Structured concurrency (partially done):** [`docs/spec/09-concurrency.md`](spec/09-concurrency.md)
is implemented for the initial M5 executable slice. The compiler parses
`scope`/`spawn`, formats the syntax, types `Task<T>`, enforces `K0701`-`K0703`,
lowers through KIR, and emits Go with a join barrier, `context.WithCancel`,
`sync.WaitGroup`, and deterministic first-error selection by spawn order.
Conformance cases `710`-`715` pass at M5, and `903-no-scope-spawn` is gated
through M4.

**Concurrency:** `scope(deadline: ...)` is fully wired — the Go backend emits
`context.WithTimeout` and returns `Cancelled` on expiry — and `check_cancel()`
lowers to a runtime cancellation checkpoint. Cases `716`–`723` (deadline
cancellation, nested deadline tightening, `check_cancel`, zero-deadline) pass.

**Generics parser (done):** `TypeParam` AST node with `name`, `bound`, `span`;
`type_params` on `FunctionDecl`, `StructDecl`, `EnumDecl`; `type_args` on `Expr::Call`,
`Expr::StructLiteral`, `ImplDecl`. Parser accepts `[T: Bound]` on functions, structs,
enums, and impls, and `[T, U]` on calls and struct literals — all gated to milestone
≥5. Diagnostic codes K0801–K0807 registered; K0801/K0804/K0805/K0806 emitted by parser;
K0802/K0803 by the typechecker; K0807 is subsumed by K0601. Pretty printer round-trips
all generic syntax.

**Known limitations:** interfaces are limited to ≤5 methods (KDR-0003); no default methods, inheritance, or structural subtyping.

## M6 — Stdlib slice (EXIT REACHED)

| Area | State |
|---|---|
| `std.time` / deadline / `check_cancel` | Done. `time.Duration`, `time.milliseconds`, `time.seconds`, `time.sleep`, `check_cancel()`, `scope(deadline: …)`. Conformance cases `716`–`723` pass. See [`docs/spec/15-stdlib-core.md §15.1–15.4`](spec/15-stdlib-core.md). |
| `std.json` | Done. `json.parse[T]`, `json.write(value)`, strict and tolerant modes, struct/enum/Option/primitive codecs, formatter round-trip, `K1503` compile-time guard. Cases `724`–`735` pass. See [`docs/m6-status.md`](m6-status.md#stdjson). |
| `std.http` | Done. Router model (`http.Router`, closure handlers, typed `path_param`/`query_param`), `http.serve`, `http.Request`/`Response`, response constructors, `K1504`/`K1505`. Cases `736`–`745`, `767`–`769` pass. See [`KDR-0031`](kdr/0031-http-router-and-params.md) (supersedes 0028) and [`m6-status.md`](m6-status.md). |
| `std.sql` | Done. `sql.connect`, `pool.query`/`query_one`/`exec`/`migrate`, `RowMapper`, `sql.Error` variants, `K1506`. Cases `770`–`775` pass. See [`KDR-0029`](kdr/0029-sql-database-access.md). |
| `std.log` | Done. `log.info`, `log.warn`, `log.error` — simple string messages to stdout. Cases `746`–`748` pass. See [`docs/spec/15-stdlib-core.md §15.25–15.27`](spec/15-stdlib-core.md). |
| `std.config` | Done. `config.load<T>()`, `Secret`/`secret.unwrap`, `config.Error` variants, env-var mapping + typed parsing, `K1507`. Cases `776`–`778` pass. See [`KDR-0030`](kdr/0030-config-loading-surface.md). |
| Core scalars | Done. `Uuid`/`Timestamp`/`Email` + constructors, JSON/HTTP parsing, canonical interpolation. Cases `779`–`793` pass. See [`KDR-0034`](kdr/0034-core-boundary-scalars.md). |
| Universal `Error` | Done. Opaque error type absorbing any propagated error at `?`/return; `catch`/`match` on it is `K0504`. Cases `511`/`512`. See [`KDR-0033`](kdr/0033-universal-error-type.md). |
| Multi-line strings | Done. Literal newlines inside `"..."`. See [`KDR-0035`](kdr/0035-multiline-string-literals.md). |
| `Struct.from_row` + error classification | Done. Auto-derived `from_row`, qualified `sql.NoRows`/`sql.UniqueViolation` patterns, union narrowing. Cases `794`–`796`. See [`KDR-0037`](kdr/0037-sql-error-classification-patterns.md)/[`KDR-0038`](kdr/0038-union-narrowing-patterns.md). |
| `examples/users-service/main.keel` | Compiles and runs full CRUD on SQLite; cases 804 and 806 lock the execution path. M6 exit criterion reached. |

**Conformance score:** 194 / 194 passed at M6, 3 skipped. The live planning note
with the step-by-step exit sequence is [`docs/m6-status.md`](m6-status.md).

## M7 — The differentiators (EXIT REACHED)

**Exit (all six must hold).** Per [`ROADMAP.md`](../ROADMAP.md) §M7, every
differentiator must be demonstrable and locked by conformance. Each is locked by
standalone conformance cases (the packaged `examples/users-service/` workspace
remains aspirational; the compiler grows to meet it). Live note:
[`docs/m7-status.md`](m7-status.md).

| Differentiator | Exit demonstrand | State |
|---|---|---|
| Manifests + capabilities | per-package `keel.toml`; transitive enforcement; `K1110` reject variant | **Implemented** — chapters [`06`](spec/06-modules-packages.md)/[`11`](spec/11-capabilities.md), `K1101`–`K1108`/`K1110`–`K1112`, cases 810–817, 820–826. |
| `keel audit` | deterministic effective-capability report for the dep graph | **Implemented** ([§11.5](spec/11-capabilities.md)), cases 827–828. |
| `arena` | `arena { }` scratch region compiles + runs safely | **Implemented** ([ch10](spec/10-memory.md), `K1001`; KDR-0012/0016), cases 830–833. |
| `keel gen` | service types generated from a proto3 schema; round-trips `keel fmt` | **Implemented** ([ch17](spec/17-codegen.md), `K1601`/`K1602`; KDR-0104), cases 834/836/837. |
| Hermetic builds | two clean builds byte-identical, no host/net leakage | **Implemented** ([ch18](spec/18-hermetic-builds.md); KDR-0105; `-trimpath`/`-buildvcs=false`), case 850. |
| Editions | manifest `edition` honored; unknown edition diagnosed | **Implemented** ([ch14](spec/14-editions.md), `K1401`–`K1403`; KDR-0001), cases 840–842. |

Function-level capability annotations ([`KDR-0017`](kdr/0017-function-capabilities.md))
remain deferred. Per-slice detail: [`docs/m7-packages-capabilities.md`](m7-packages-capabilities.md).

**Conformance score:** **221 passed, 0 failed, 4 skipped** at M7
(`KEEL_MILESTONE=M7 scripts/preflight.sh`). The 4 skips are not-in-Core
rejections bounded to ≤M4/≤M6.

## M8 — Incremental compiler core + LSP (implementation slice started)

| Area | State |
|---|---|
| Query decision | [`KDR-0106`](kdr/0106-query-engine.md) accepted Salsa and fixed the query/input boundary. The database lives in its own `keelc-query` crate (not driver-internal), so `keelc-driver` and `keelc-lsp` share it without a dependency cycle. |
| Performance harness | [`tests/performance/m8-reference`](../tests/performance/m8-reference/README.md) and [`scripts/m8-benchmark.sh`](../scripts/m8-benchmark.sh) define the generated corpus and metric comparison. The `m8-benchmark` CI job runs it on every compiler PR; `--enforce` and nonzero baselines are not wired in yet. |
| LSP decision | [`KDR-0103`](kdr/0103-lsp-server.md) accepted the M8 base capability set and `lsp-server`/`lsp-types` protocol stack. |
| LSP spec | [`docs/spec/16-lsp.md`](spec/16-lsp.md) defines the M8 base capability set explicitly and defers non-base capabilities. |
| LSP fixtures | Done. [`tests/lsp/m8-base`](../tests/lsp/m8-base) covers all ten base-capability transcripts: initialize, diagnostics (ASCII + UTF-16/CRLF), shutdown, JSON-RPC errors, go-to-definition, hover, completion, document symbols, incremental `didChange`, and multi-line position mapping. |
| Implementation | `keel check`, `run`, `test`, and `build` route parse, resolve, typecheck, KIR, Go emission, and diagnostics through Salsa queries. `keelc-lsp` and `keel lsp` are implemented and pass all ten fixtures byte-for-byte; module-level symbol resolution only (no local/parameter scope yet). |

M8a delivers the query core and KDR-0019 performance gate; M8b delivers the
base LSP capabilities. A public 0.1.0 preview additionally needs the release
readiness items in [`docs/0.1-release-readiness.md`](0.1-release-readiness.md).
See [`docs/m8-status.md`](m8-status.md).

## Planned milestones

| Milestone | Scope | Governing constraint |
|---|---|---|
| M9 | Reproducible daemonless OCI images | Extend KDR-0105/chapter 18 through a new KDR + chapter 19 |
| M10 | OpenAPI codegen + C FFI ecosystem bridges | KDR-0104, KDR-0011, KDR-0020; chapter 12 required first |
| M11 | Native backend and 1.0 gate | KDR-0102 requires replacement of the Go backend before 1.0 |

Preview gating/`keel fix`, function capabilities, and extra arena analysis are
trigger-gated rather than assigned speculative milestone numbers; see
[`ROADMAP.md`](../ROADMAP.md) §Trigger-gated work.
